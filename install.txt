2. Create new database using phpMyAdmin or some other way.
Couple of params you need to remeber — host, database user, name and password.

3. Import database dump from /cogear.sql to created database.

4. Open /site.php and change string

'dsn' => 'mysql://root@localhost/cogear',

to

'dsn' => 'mysql://database_user[:database_password]@database_host/database_name',

Where [] — means "Optional".

Also change 'site' => 'url' param to your site domain without http:// and www.

Just like 'cogear.new' or 'localhost'.

5. Start your web-site and finish the installation process.
